# LlamaIndex + GraphRAG + Ollama + Neo4j
<!-- more -->
## 1. Improvements in the Official Implementation
- Replace the OpenAI model with the local Ollama model
    - llm: llama3
    - embedding model: nomic-embed-text
- Use a local Neo4j graph database
- Optimize the prompt for extracting entities and relationships from the graph and the corresponding parsing function

## 2. Overall Process
1. Load data and split it into text blocks
2. Extract entities and relationships from each text block
3. Summarize all entities and relationships from the text blocks to obtain complete graph information
4. Store graph information in the Neo4j graph database and create an index
5. Group related nodes in the graph into communities and generate summaries for each community
6. Retrieve community summaries, generate answers from each summary, and aggregate these answers into a final response

## 3. Implementation
### 3.1. Install Required Libraries
```
!pip install -i https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple llama-index-graph-stores-neo4j graspologic numpy scipy==1.12.0 future 
```
### 3.2. Load Data

news = pd.read_csv(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomasonjo/blog-datasets/main/news_articles.csv"

### 3.3. Extract Entities and Relationships
#### 3.3.1. Define GraphRAGExtractor Class
- The GraphRAGExtractor class is used to extract entities and relationships in the form of subject-relation-object triples from text.
- Key Components
    - llm: The LLM used for extracting entities and relationships
    - extract_prompt: The prompt used for extracting entities and relationships
    - parse_fn: The parsing function to convert LLM output into structured data
    - num_workers: Number of threads to process multiple texts simultaneously
- Main Methods
    - __call__: Entry point for processing
    - acall: Asynchronous version of call
    - _aextract: Core method
- Extraction Process for Each Text Block
    - 1. Pass the text block and extract_prompt to the LLM
    - 2. Obtain the LLM's response: extracted entities and relationships and their descriptions
    - 3. Parse the LLM's response using parse_fn to get EntityNode and Relation objects
    - 4. Add the extracted entities and relationships information from all text blocks to the node metadata under KG_NODES_KEY and KG_RELATIONS_KEY

-Goal-
Given a text document, identify all entities and their entity types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
Given the text.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Type of the entity
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relation: relationship between source_entity and target_entity
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other

3. Output Formatting:
- Return the result in valid JSON format with two keys: 'entities' (list of entity objects) and 'relationships' (list of relationship objects).
- Exclude any text outside the JSON structure (e.g., no explanations or comments).
- If no entities or relationships are identified, return empty lists: { "entities": [], "relationships": [] }.

-An Output Example-
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "entity_name": "Albert Einstein",
      "entity_type": "Person",
      "entity_description": "Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity and made significant contributions to physics."

### 3.6. Build Communities and Generate Community Summaries
Use community detection algorithms to group related nodes in the graph, then use a large language model (LLM) to generate summaries for each community.

```
index.property_graph_store.build_communities()
```

### 3.7. GraphRAG Query
#### 3.7.1. Define GraphRAGQueryEngine Class
- The GraphRAGQueryEngine class is a custom query engine designed to handle queries using the GraphRAG method. It utilizes community summaries generated by the GraphRAGStore to answer user queries.
- Main Components
    - graph_store: An instance of GraphRAGStore containing community summaries
    - llm: The language model used to generate and aggregate answers
- Key Methods
    - custom_query(query_str: str)
        - Main entry point for queries
        - Used to retrieve community summaries, generate answers from each summary, and aggregate these answers into a final response
    - generate_answer_from_summary(community_summary, query)
        - Generate an answer for a query based on a single community summary
        - Use LLM to interpret the community summary in the context of the query
    - aggregate_answers(community_answers)
        - Combine individual answers from different communities into a coherent final response
        - Use LLM to synthesize multiple perspectives into a concise answer
- Query Processing Flow
    - 1. Retrieve community summaries from the graph store
    - 2. Generate specific answers for the query from each community summary
    - 3. Aggregate all community-specific answers into a final, coherent response

#### 3.7.2. Instantiate GraphRAGQueryEngine as query_engine Object
```
query_engine = GraphRAGQueryEngine(
    graph_store=index.property_graph_store, 
    llm=llm,
    index=index,
    similarity_top_k=10

#### 3.7.3. Retrieve Information
```

)
display(Markdown(f"{response.response}"))
```
> Here is the combined response:
The main news discussed in the document is a debate on retained firefighters' pay, with Sinn Féin TDs John Brady and Pearse Doherty advocating for their rights. Specifically, John Brady interrupted Minister for Housing Darragh O'Brien's speech to emphasize the importance of retaining firefighters' pay, while Pearse Doherty called on the minister to make an improved offer in relation to pay and meet with them outside of the House.
