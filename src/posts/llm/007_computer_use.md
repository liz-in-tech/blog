## 4. Features of Computer Use 
Use computers the way people do — by looking at a screen, moving a cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text.

- 1. translate instructions into computer commands (e.g.    fill out a form with the data from those pages; and so on)
  -  user commands
     -  use data from my computer and online to fill out this form
  -  translate into a series of computer commands
     -  check a spreadsheet;
     -  move the cursor to open a web browser;
     -  navigate to the relevant web pages;
     -  fill out a form with the data from those pages.
- 2. to interpret what’s happening on a screen and then use the software tools available to carry out tasks
- 3. Position the cursor to a specific location on the screen
  - calculate how many pixels the cursor needs to move vertically or horizontally to click on the right spot
  - Training Claude to count pixels accurately was critical. 
  - Claude trained on this.
- 4. self-correct and retry tasks when it encountered obstacles
 
## 5. Future directions
- Improve safety
- Reduce costs
- Increase speed
- Reduce Error Rate and increase Reliability
- Support more operations
  - Operations such as drag and drop, zoom, etc. are not yet supported.
- Performance Improvement of Visual Large Language Models (VLMs)
  - Current VLMs are generally ‘myopic’ in the sense that they can only extract approximate and abstract visual information from an image, and do not really see the picture as a human would.
- Changing viewing screenshots to finer-grained video streams
  - Claude observes the screen by taking screenshots that are ‘flip-book’ style, i.e. taking screenshots and piecing them together, rather than observing a finer-grained video stream, which means that it may miss brief actions or notifications.
- Combination of visual and code manipulation
  - Relying on vision alone doesn't improve speed or accuracy enough
