# Graph Database Neo4j
<!-- more -->
## 1. Introduction to Neo4j
Neo4j is a high-performance NoSQL graph database focused on storing and querying complex relational data.

Graph databases are a type of NoSQL database based on graph theory, with data storage structures and query methods grounded in graph theory.

Features
- Data Model: Uses a graph structure of nodes, relationships, and properties to intuitively represent complex connections between entities.
- Query Language: Supports the Cypher declarative query language, simplifying graph traversal operations.
- Performance Advantage: Achieves efficient relational queries through index-free adjacency and other designs, especially in deep traversal scenarios (such as K-Hop queries), with response speeds potentially thousands of times faster than traditional databases.
- Transaction Support: Fully compatible with ACID transactions, ensuring data consistency.

## 2. Installation on Mac
```
brew install neo4j
```

## 3. Start
```
neo4j start
```

## 4. Restart
```
neo4j restart
```

## 5. Stop

1. Check the version, e.g., version 2025.01.0
```
neo4j --version
```

2. Download the corresponding version of the jar file from GitHub
https://github.com/neo4j/apoc/releases

3. Move the jar file to the plugins directory of neo4j
```
Directories in use:
home:         /opt/homebrew/Cellar/neo4j/2025.01.0/libexec
config:       /opt/homebrew/Cellar/neo4j/2025.01.0/libexec/conf
logs:         /opt/homebrew/var/log/neo4j
plugins:      /opt/homebrew/Cellar/neo4j/2025.01.0/libexec/plugins

```

4. Modify the neo4j.conf configuration file in the conf path

Add the following content
```
dbms.security.procedures.unrestricted=apoc.*
dbms.security.procedures.allowlist=apoc.*
```

5. Verify after restarting neo4j
```
RETURN apoc.version()
```
